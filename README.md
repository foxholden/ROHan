About
----------------------

ROHan is a Bayesian framework to estimate local rates of heterozygosity, infer runs of homozygosity (ROH) and compute global rates of heterozygosity. ROHan can work on modern and ancient samples with signs of ancient DNA damage.

Description
----------------------

Diploid organisms have minor differences between corresponding pairs of autosomes. Differences of a single nucleotide create heterozygous sites. Very recent inbreeding can lead to large stretches of genomic deserts of heterozygosous sites. Such deserts are called runs of homozygosity (ROH). 

Due to the lack of heterozygosous sites, ROHs can cause an underestimate of global estimates of heterozygosity. Such global estimates of rates of heterozygous sites is useful to infer population genetics parameters such as effective population size (Ne). 

Analysis of ancient samples obtained using ancient DNA (aDNA), in addition to being plagued by potential ROHs due to inbreeding, often have presence of post-mortem molecular damage and can often have low coverage due to a paucity of endogenous material.

ROHan aims at:
1) providing an estimate of local rates of heterozygosity that is robust to low coverage and post-mortem damage. 
2) identifying ROHs using the results from 1). This is done via an hidden markov model whose parameters are optimized using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo
3) using both 1) and 2), provide a global rate of heterozygosity

Downloading:
----------------------

Go to https://github.com/grenaud/rohan and either:

1) Download the ZIP 

or

2) Do a "git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/grenaud/rohan.git"


Holden's installation for HPC
----------------------
## Create a conda environment with all dependencies:
```
mamba create -n rohan -c conda-forge \
  cmake autoconf automake libtool libpng pkg-config \
  gsl bzip2 xz zlib curl ncurses \
  gcc_linux-64 gxx_linux-64 binutils_linux-64
```
## Activate the environment:
```
conda activate rohan
```
## Create symbolic links between ncurses and curses libraries
```
ln -s $CONDA_PREFIX/lib/libncurses.so $CONDA_PREFIX/lib/libcurses.so
ln -s $CONDA_PREFIX/lib/libncurses.a $CONDA_PREFIX/lib/libcurses.a
ln -s $CONDA_PREFIX/lib/libncurses.so.6 $CONDA_PREFIX/lib/libcurses.so.6
```
## Then compile:
```
cd ROHan
make
```

(optional) Either put the executable in the overall path or add the path to your $PATH environment or add an alias to be able to run "rohan" from any directory.


Quick start
----------------------

For test data, make sure you are connected to the internet and type:
     cd testData/
     make

This will run ROHan on chromosome 21 for: 
* a West African individual from Phase 3 of the 1000G project
* the ancient Loschbour individual (Lazardis et al.). Please be aware that the command for the profile uses no quality score filter: "-minq 0" because the quality scores were artificially decreased to account for damage during calling. We generally do not recommend this as this will inflate substitution rate. 

For these cases, the theta estimate have very large confidence due to the use of a single chromosome. 


Preparing the BAM file
-----------------

1) Make sure you know the transition/transversion ratio for the species/population you are working with. This ratio will be specified via:

    rohan --tstv [TSTV ratio] 

2) Do not apply any filters as mapping quality and base quality are all informative in the model. Duplicate removal is very recommended. Simply use the fail QC flag to remove reads/fragments that have failed basic quality control (e.g. for duplicates). Simply sort and index and provide ROHan the same reference used for mapping. 


3) Is your sample ancient DNA? if not skip to 5). If the sample has aDNA damage, it should be quantified in incorporated in the calculation. There are 2 ways to do this:

i) If the sample is not too divergent from the reference used you can simply use:

    bam2prof/bam2prof

 To get the best results, take a substantial subsample of your original BAM file and use it in bam2prof. 
 a) Find the ideal length for the -length parameter. Try increasing until substition rates level off.
 b) Keep increasing  -minq from 0 until the damage levels off.
 c) If you have a high rate of substitutions outside of expected ones (e.g. C->T, G->A) consider using the second option (see ii) )
 d) Have a look at the command line in the test data directory.

ii) Use the script to estimate damage by masking polymorphic positions, this is especially important if the divergence between the reference genome and sample is great and there are a lot of polymorphic positions:

    src/estimateDamage.pl    [reference fasta] [input .bam file]

 For example:

    src/estimateDamage.pl    Equcab20_nucl.fasta ancientHorse.bam

 type the command without any arguments for a description of the different arguments.
 
4) Do you have extensive ancient DNA damage (e.g. 20% at the ends of greater) which could potentially affect the mapping? If so, we recommend filtering for reads in highly mappable regions, see : http://lh3lh3.users.sourceforge.net/snpable.shtml  to create mappability tracks.

5) Create a file with the name of the autosomes, 1 chromosome per line ex:
    chr1
    chr2
    ...

6) Run ROHan, for modern samples run:

     rohan --rohmu 2e-5   -o  [output prefix]  [reference genome]  [BAM file]

For ancient samples run:

     rohan --rohmu 2e-5 --deam5p  deamfile.5p.prof  --deam3p  deamfile.3p.prof    -o  [output prefix]  [reference genome]  [BAM file]

where deamfile.5p.prof and deamfile.3p.prof are the substitution rates due to aDNA damage and not due to sequencing errors. You can add more threads in the calculation using "-t". Be aware that as this is a full likelihood model, the data needs to live in memory and therefore, using multiple threads can result in higher memory usage.

If a mappability track was used, you can add the option: --map to filter wrt to mappable regions.

7) Inspect your results. Refer to [output prefix].het_1_X.pdf and [output prefix].hmm_1_X.pdf, if there are regions labeled as non ROH despite the fact that they clearly show a depression in heterozygosity, re-run using --hmm and a higher value of --rohmu (e.g. for the example above, one could run using 5e-5).

8) For ancient samples, if the result if really unexpected, you can re-run using --tvonly which will limit the estimate to transversions, the heterozygosity needs to be multiplied by (Ts/Tv+1) (ex: if Ts/Tv  = 2.1, multiply the results it by 3.1). This estimate can be an underestimate due to the lack of data.

The first line is for Watterson's theta for genomic regions excluding runs of homozygosity. The second is for Watterson's theta for the entire genome, including runs of homozygosity. 

FAQ
----------------------



### Why do I have such huge confidence intervals for potential ROH regions?

This is normal, as we use the second derivative for the confidence intervals, the shape of the likelihood function is somewhat flat around 0 which leads to overestimated confidence intervals. 


### I have regions that have clear signs of being runs of homozygosity however they do not get flagged as such, why?

It is possible that you have genuine ROH but if you have a slight overestimate of the rate of local heterozygosity do to him properly calibrated weapon qualities or  base qualities. Therefore such regions will not be flagged as being ROHs. It is advisable to rerun with --rohmu XXX where XXX is the "heterozygosity rate" in ROH regions you are willing to tolerate

### What are the 3 different lines on the HMM plot?

- The green line is the output using the point estimates. Margenta are the estimates using upper bounds for local het. rates whereas red were computed using lower bounds of het. rates.


### What is the difference between --bed and --map?

- By default, ROHan generates windows of "--size"bp along autosomes, you can override this and use the regions in a bed file. With either option, you can specify individual sites to consider using --map, this is recommended for ancient samples with short fragment size and with some damage.


### The percentage of classified segments does not sum up to one (100%), why?

- The % of segments should not necessarily sum up to one. Segments can be:

* in ROH
* not in ROH
* not sure

Therefore, because of the segments in the "not sure" category, this percentages will not necessarily sum up to 100%.

        abstract = "{Both the total amount and the distribution of heterozygous sites within individual genomes are informative about the genetic diversity of the population they belong to. Detecting true heterozygous sites in ancient genomes is complicated by the generally limited coverage achieved and the presence of post-mortem damage inflating sequencing errors. Additionally, large runs of homozygosity found in the genomes of particularly inbred individuals and of domestic animals can skew estimates of genome-wide heterozygosity rates. Current computational tools aimed at estimating runs of homozygosity and genome-wide heterozygosity levels are generally sensitive to such limitations. Here, we introduce ROHan, a probabilistic method which substantially improves the estimate of heterozygosity rates both genome-wide and for genomic local windows. It combines a local Bayesian model and a Hidden Markov Model at the genome-wide level and can work both on modern and ancient samples. We show that our algorithm outperforms currently available methods for predicting heterozygosity rates for ancient samples. Specifically, ROHan can delineate large runs of homozygosity (at megabase scales) and produce a reliable confidence interval for the genome-wide rate of heterozygosity outside of such regions from modern genomes with a depth of coverage as low as 5–6× and down to 7–8× for ancient samples showing moderate DNA damage. We apply ROHan to a series of modern and ancient genomes previously published and revise available estimates of heterozygosity for humans, chimpanzees and horses.}",
